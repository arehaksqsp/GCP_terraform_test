These are my attempts at educating myself on both Terraform and Google Cloud, two technologies which I have have toyed with occasionally but have not really sat down with. I realized that I could probably deploy quite a bit of infrastructure via command line, by using GitHub in its raw format, pulling down code into GCP instances as a shell script, then running the shell script from within Cloud Shell. I'm sure there's a more elegant way of 
accomplishing these things but those are in the wheelhouse of the software engineer, while I am an infrastructure engineer who's trying to educate himself. This approach combined tools I already know with tools that are 
somewhat new to me, which seems like an effective way to develop new skills. My ultimate gal here is to spin up various services in GCP by simply telling new resources to pull needed information from these repositories, then build out what is needed. If I get really good, I'll have all my different instances talking to each other, too.
